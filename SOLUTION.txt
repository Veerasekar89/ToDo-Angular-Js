Angular JS
==========
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template
language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. 
AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
